Since we are doing a mobile first website, our presentation may differ slightly when in mobile view. If the designers have a specific mobile view in mind hopefully they will send a relevant document with that design.

Make sure to install any missing fonts and verify that they are correctly displayed in the document.

Use quick export to break up the layers into images we can use on our site. If the file is not nicely presented you may have to use the slice tool.
